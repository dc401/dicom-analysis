**This is part of a tutorial written on:** 
[How to Simulate and Troubleshoot Medical Imaging Transfers](https://dwchow.medium.com/how-to-simulate-and-troubleshoot-medical-imaging-transfers-8f328de80c03)

If you're looking for just the PCAP for DICOM image transfer analysis it's [here](https://github.com/dc401/dicom-analysis/raw/main/pcap-dicom-image-xfer.pcapng).

At the end of this article you should be able to:
-   Have a fundamental understanding of a common medical imaging protocol  
    and standard
-   Be able to deploy two different client / server vendor software  
    utilizing that standard
-   Troubleshoot basic network and configuration support requirements  
    between the two vendors
-   Understand the security implications and compensating controls needed  
    around these systems
